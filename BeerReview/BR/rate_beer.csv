,"Double Vision Doppelbock was first brewed in 2009 to highlight our brewery’s wonderful water.  
Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the 
world’s best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-
quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-
Aroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 22˚ Plato.  The malts 
provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with 
a hint of smoke.  It is lightly spiced with German Hallertau Tradition hops and fermented with 
lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48˚F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called “liquid bread” and 
named “Holy Father” to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since “bock” also means “billy goat” in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision’s slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for game—venison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boar—especially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and sautéed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet 
sausages, ham or prosciutto.  It’s wonderful with cheese and dessert, too.  Pair it with an aged 
gruyère, a caramel flan, or a crème brûlée.",,Grand Teton Double Vision Doppelbock,2,Doppelbock,Grand Teton Brewing Co.,40,,/,98,132,IDAHO,99,

Koko Buni is a lovely milk porter that we’ve brewed and aged on toasted coconut, cocoa nibs from Athens’ own Condor Chocolates, and coffee from our friends at 1000 faces.

,"In honor of the 40th anniversary of the original release of Bitches Brew, Miles Davis’ 1970 paradigm-shifting landmark fusion breakthrough, we’ve created our own Bitches Brew - a bold, dark beer that’s a fusion of three threads imperial stout and one thread honey beer with gesho root, a gustatory analog to Miles’ masterpiece.Featuring the album’s iconic artwork, created by the late Mati Klarwein, on its label, Dogfish Head’s Bitches Brew will be unveiled at SAVOR, An American Craft Beer & Food Experience, June 5, National Building Museum, Washington DC.

Haven’t experienced the Bitches Brew album? Two 40th anniversary editions of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew -- a Legacy Edition and a deluxe Collector’s Edition -- will be available Tuesday, August 31.

The newly created ale is designed, according to Dogfish founder and president Sam Calagione, ""as the ultimate partner for chili or spicy curry chicken"" and best enjoyed ""sipped cool, not cold, from a snifter or red wine glass while listening to the Bitches Brew album.""

Calagione was drawn to the alchemical spirits in Bitches Brew right out of college, acquiring a copy of the album ""within months of the first time I brewed a batch of homebrew in my apartment in New York City. I listened to it when I was writing my Dogfish business plan. I wanted Dogfish Head to be a maniacally inventive and creative brewery, analog beer for the digital age. You could say that my dream was to have Dogfish Head, in some small way, stand for the same thing in the beer world that Bitches Brew stands for in the jazz world. You can imagine how excited we are to be doing this project 17 years after I wrote that business plan.""

""There’s a spirit of innovation, of creativity and individuality, thats at the core of Miles’ music,"" said Adam Block, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Legacy Recordings. ""Sam and Dogfish Head approach their art from the same place and consequently the marriage is an easy and cool one.""

Dogfish Head and its ""off-centered ales for off-centered people"" were the subject of ""A Better Brew,"" an article in The New Yorker (Nov. 24, 2008) examining the rise of extreme beer. ""Beer has lagged well behind wine and organic produce in the ongoing reinvention of American cuisine. Yet the change over the past twenty years has been startling,"" wrote Burkhard Bilger. ""Dogfish is something of a mascot for this unruly movement. In the thirteen years since Calagione founded the brewery, it has gone from being the smallest in the country to the thirty-eighth largest. Calagione makes more beer with at least ten per cent alcohol than any other brewer, and his odd ingredients are often drawn from ancient or obscure beer traditions.

,"You’ve made it to 547 Haight Street. This destination is more San Francisco than Rice A Roni, Chinatown, and Lombard Street combined. Welcome to Broadway for brewers everywhere. Everyone who is anyone has poured their kegs here. For the last 20 years, this place has launched careers, confirmed legacies, and since 1987 the only name you need to know is David Keene.

Take a seat. Tip Strong. Nod appreciatively and don’t ask stupid questions. Welcome to Big Daddy’s House known to most simply as ""The T-Room."" Here the bartenders are fluent in English, German, Flemish, French, Waloon and Czech. But they’re most known for their American Lip Service. Watch it. The lady with the jet black hair behind the bar eats idiots for lunch.

At 547 Haight Street, you won’t find any Cable Cars except for this one. But if you’re standing outside the Dutch Doors of the World Famous Toranado, you surely found the most interesting place in all San Francisco. Its’ about RESPECT. Dave you continue to have ours. Here’s to 20 more years of punishing livers everywhere.

That’s because ""ice cold"" is certainly not the appropriate way to serve the beer. Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be.

Bitter Monk Belgian Double IPA is such a beer. Redolent of citrusy hop bittering and massive malt infusion, this is a beer to ponder, to sip, and, even for a monk, to dream. Why then is the monk so bitter? What provokes that sly smile? What is he wearing under that flowing robe? A triple-fermented beer gives him three times the mystery. Remember, anything worth doing is worth over doing. Nothing exceeds like excess. Even for the cloistered.
And what rough monk, his hour come round at last, slinks slowly toward Brussels to be reborn.",,Anchorage Bitter Monk Belgian Style Double IPA,6,Imperial IPA,Anchorage Brewing Company,270,100,/,100,402,ALASKA,99,

,- A deep amber colored ale with a noticeable hop aroma.  All of the flavors and aromas of a highly hopped beer are balanced with a combination of several quality barley malts to prove a surprisingly drinkable 7.47% ABV beer.  At BBW we believe that an IPA should have a good malt character to sing along with the abundance of bittering and flavor hops used.  This beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized and is partially bottle conditioned therefore it may have a small amount of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  We suggest letting this beer warm up slightly from refrigeration temperature then pour into 2 clean clear pint glasses roughing the beer up a bit (pour aggressively) at the end of each pour to bring up a nice thick head.  You may reserve any sediment and dispose or drink it - please don’t be afraid of sediment!  It is the result of living yeast and is yummy.

BACK STORY:

Here at DC Brau we love our hoppy beers. This is our latest attempt in seeing how many hops we can fit into a DIPA and I think we’ve hit a new mark. This beer clocks in around 100 IBU, similar to OTWOA but uses 4 different varieties instead of 1. Alpha-Domina-Mellis was also brewed with 30 lbs of Wildflower honey from Burnside Farms in Haymarket, VA that was added at the end of the 90 min boil and then 30 lbs added directly into the fermenter on the second day of primary fermentation.

TASTING NOTES:

Alpha-Domina-Mellis leads in with a peach-like color and a distinctive tropical / pineapple like nose with a hint of breadiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a huge, lingering bitterness provided by the huge dose of experimental hops that were added early in the boil. What the drinker is left with is a bitterness that won’t quit followed by a heavy tropical, fruity, ""juicy fruit"" bubblegum like aroma with a lingering aroma reminiscent of star fruit and stone fruit.",/upload/post.asp?m=1&Id=233588,DC Brau Alpha Domina Mellis,16,Imperial IPA,DC Brau Brewing Company,255,,3.76/5.0,95,23,WASHINGTON DC,78,3.64

12.8%,"The idea behind Double Barrel Big Bad Baptist was born when our friends at HotBox Roasters, based out of Longmont, CO told us they’ve been aging green coffee beans in retired spirits barrels. Our eyes widened at the possibilities, it was like a new frontier of flavor had been opened up. 

Green coffee beans are like sponges, they soak up the aromas and flavors of their environment. If you put them in a used whiskey barrel, you’ll get notes of toffee, vanilla, oak, and campfire alongside the beans natural fruity and roasted flavors. The barrel aged coffees coming from HotBox are some of the most exciting and truly unique coffees we’ve tasted. We selected their single origin Ethopian Yirgacheffe for its bright blueberry and pomegranate flavors. It’s a major departure from the classic Columbian and Central American flavor profile we normally select for Big Bad Baptist but with the additional flavor contribution from the whiskey barrel and Hot Box’s carful roasting, the coffee comes to the forefront of the beer and really showcases the unique process.

To accommodate the bold flavors of the coffee we sourced equally creative and maliciously crafted cacao nibs from Solstice Chocolate. Solstice Chocolate is a small artisan chocolate maker based out of Salt Lake City. They specialize in sourcing exotic, organically grown cacao from around the world. Each single origin cacao is roasted in house to bring out its inherent characteristics.

7.3%,"We are pleased to introduce Jester King Bière de Syrah — a barrel-aged sour beer refermented with Syrah grapes. Bière de Syrah consists of a blend of beer fermented in oak barrels for nine to twelve months with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. The blend was then refermented with Syrah grapes for about two weeks, transferred off of the fruit, then aged for an additional nine months in oak barrels. After packaging, the beer naturally conditioned for an additional two months prior to release. Altogether, Bière de Syrah is roughly two years old.

Bière de Syrah spent considerably more time aging than most of our other fruited sour beers. This is due to the fact that our Barrel Program Head Adrienne Ballou likes the practice of racking (transferring) beer refermented with wine grapes back into oak barrels for further maturation. Adrienne came to Jester King from the wine world and brought several winemaking techniques with her. According to Adrienne, maturation in oak barrels following fruit refermentation allows the beer to take on more complex characteristics than just bright fruit character and acidity.

The grapes used in the refermentation of Bière de Syrah came from the 2014 harvest in California. We attempt to use native Texas fruit whenever possible, but in this case, we had difficultly sourcing Texas grapes last year. Most of the grapes from the 2014 Texas harvest went to winemakers. Fortunately, we’ve developed some great relationships with wineries in our area, so hopefully this will be the last time we source grapes from California, or anywhere outside of Texas.

Bière de Syrah was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the Texas Hill Country prior to refermentation with Syrah grapes. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned in bottles, kegs, and casks.

Davis and worked in the wine industry in France. During her time at Jester King, she has implemented numerous wine making techniques into our fermentations, including our use of punch downs during our fruit refermentations. Punch downs lead to better flavor and color extraction from the fruit during refermentation and aid in keeping acetic acid development (think vinegar) at bay.

,"A lot of time went into making this beer. This isn’t to suggest that very long periods of maturation in oak automatically lead to good beer. Far from it. In fact, some of our favorite beers we’ve made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we’re really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn’t to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned.

,"In 2006, the Coastal Extreme Brewing Crew started the Cyclone Series, a clever idea before limited release beers were the norm. This clever idea produced 26 different beers ranging widely in taste, complexity, and lack of sleep for our brewers! We traveled through the alphabet, with no shortcuts, starting with Alyssa and now introducing, the last letter ‘Z’ for Zach, an imperial oatmeal stout.

Cyclone Zach is an intense beer, both in its brewing and flavor profile. Six mashes, rather than the usual two, were required to create this brew, leading to round the clock brewing. Boasting a 10.1% ABV Zach is truly a big and bold beer, but his most important characteristic is smoothness. To create Zach’s silky smooth flavor, the brewers combined extra tank conditioning time with the addition of the most flaked oat ever used in a Storm brew, to balance the otherwise over intense roasted backbone of the beer. This Cyclone will stand up to the test of time, our Brew Master recommends aging this beer for years to come.",,Newport Storm Cyclone Series Zach,22,Imperial Stout,Coastal Extreme Brewing Company,47,,3.65/5.0,82,12,RHODE ISLAND,22,3.35

,"Brewing this Cyclone wasn’t as easy as previous ones; it took round-the-clock brewing and three “maxed mash tuns” to deliver the high extract/sugar content which would translate into Vlad’s hefty ~ 9% ABV.  Further, extra tank conditioning time was required to create the smoothness.
All of the additional production effort is easily rewarded for those who love stouts specializing in dark roasted and chocolate flavors.  Over 15% of this finished brew was created by a confluence of darker specialty grains chosen to be just under the “whoa, that is an intense flavor” threshold.  Vlad drinks remarkably balanced given the higher alcohol and dark malt additions with flavors of rounded baker’s chocolate and dark roasted coffee.  We also used a new ingredient to us: chocolate wheat, to help create the lasting thick tan foam head that invites you to the next warming sip out of your favorite tasting glass. 
Warrior hops were chosen as the sole hop in this brew and were only added to create a rounded bitterness to compliment all that dark malty sweetness.
